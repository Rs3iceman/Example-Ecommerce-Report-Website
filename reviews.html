			Generally in respect to commerce the internet has two functions, either users are searching for answers, or advertisers are searching for customers for commercial interactions, therefore the description of the internet’s worth should be broken down into two parts: the value of adverts to advertisers and the value of search results to users. Google currently controls over 80% of the Desktop Search Engine Market however suppose Google ceased to exist, advertisers would instantly lose lots of commerce due to both not being able to find customers and customers not being able to find websites. However over time users would use other search engines and advertisers would spend billions of dollars in different ways to find customers. This shows that even though the internet has great worth to businesses, if the entire internet vanished, the long run loss in value would be substantially less than the immediate impact.

			E-commerce has great value to businesses, this can be shown by the data displaying that 8.7% of the total retail spending worldwide is on Retail ecommerce sales, almost $2 billion in 2016. Yet this is only increasing, forecasts show that the percentage of Ecommerce sales against the Total retail sales worldwide will increase by, on average, 1.5% per year, therefore by 2020 nearly 15% of total retail sales worldwide will be spent on E-commerce sites. This is further increased by the prediction that Total retail sales worldwide will increase steadily by 5-6% each year.

			Jack Ma Yun, founder of Alibaba believes that e-commerce will become a traditional business in coming years and predicts a radical change in the global retail industry. Alibaba’s future goal is not to shift transactions from offline to online but to create fundamental digital and physical infrastructure to integrate online and offline retail activities across a single value chain. Ma Yun claims this will be a rebirth of the retail industry and promises to help traditional retailers upgrade to the new digital retail model not only in china but to extend its reach to companies across the globe. Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms provide a vast online marketplace which today is used by more than 10 million small businesses in china however Ma Yun believes that the commerce infrastructure created in china may be applied to a global scale. If these goals are achieved then e-commerce will have even greater value to traditional and new businesses in the future.

			The Value of the Internet can be seen in the real life examples of Amazon.com against traditional bookstores, and the Ford Motor Company’s Extranet. Amazon was founded in 1994 by CEO Jeff Bezos, when Bezos realised that there are e-commerce advantages of a web store that are unavailable to a traditional retail store. Years previously, traditional bookstores were forced into building bigger stores to meet demand and to more efficiently manage their inventories. However these business models require significant investments in both real estate and inventories.  Bezos realised this was not the case with web stores. Amazon gained direct customer advantage over bookstores by being able to be open 24/7, with unlimited shelf-space, providing customers with other 2.5million titles, compared to even the biggest bookstores having an inventory of 170,000. Amazon also has the advantage that it can be accessed via search and retrieval systems, as well as offering reviews and title recommendations which allow the customer to find their product faster and easier, providing a better customer experience. Being a web store also gives the cost benefits of only needing a centralized largely automated system of distribution, this reduces compilations in the supply chain and directly reduces the cost of distributing. These benefits have allowed amazon to have over 40% of the market of paperback books in America in 2015, this has allowed Bezos to have a net worth of over $70 billion. In 1997 the Ford Motor Company rolled out their FocalPT extranet which provides customer support worldwide through their network of 15,000 dealers. FocalPT keeps repair records for individual vehicles online throughout the dealership chain and helps salespeople close a deal. The extranet consists of a network of both intranet and internet elements which establish secure communications and data exchange throughout the company. This offers Ford with faster and cheaper publishing and distribution of manuals and other documentation, as well as giving enhanced inter-company collaboration for systems such as purchasing, inventory control and distribution. This provides affordable information transportation reducing the associated costs of travel and communication, decreasing training costs as well.

			Bellroy.com is a Melbourne based start-up company founded in 2010 by Andrew Fallshaw and Hadrien Monloup, both entrepreneurs came from design backgrounds with the aim of helping people carry everything they need in less space. This has been achieved by selling wallets, designed to eliminate leather and air between cards to create a more elegant wallet, reducing wallet bulge and promoting ease of access. The name Bellroy comes from a merge between Bells Beach, the location of their marketing and sales team, and Fitzroy, the location of their creative division, tech dome and business engine. Before Bellroy, the entrepreneurs started the Carryology online carry community website, which shares articles and posts about everything to do with Bags and wallets. This started as a concept website but soon grew to have an international reputation, from there Monloup and Fallshaw realised that there was a gap in the market for a company selling solely wallets. Carryology still exists today and is linked to bellroy.com.

			Bellroy is upfront in their privacy policy, they clearly state what information they collect, which is split into three categories: Customer Information, Usage Data and IP Address Details.
			<br>
			Customer information includes your name, email address, shipping and billing information and payment details; this is given to Bellroy when you sign up to the newsletter or make an online Purchase and is used to identify you. Bellroy use the customer information to fulfil orders placed by you, deliver newsletters to you and other day-to-day activities. Bellroy states they use a 128-bit SSL encryption to protect your online information as well as 256-bit SSL encryption for financial details which is the industry standard. Bellroy also collects your usage data and IP address, this includes which pages you visited, how you got to the website, which links you clicked on when on the website and if you’ve used the website before.
			<br>
			Usage data is collected through cookies placed by Bellroy and other third parties, this data is used to gather analytics of their users which is used to help map their customer demographic and improve their website and optimise customer experience. Geographical location is also contained in usage data and helps the website display the content in the correct language, with the correct currency and pricing. Evidence of this can be seen as they say they provide free shipping to the United Kingdom in the header, even though the company is Australian. Usage data is also used for remarketing, which better target their adverts at users, their adverts will change depending on what brand or websites you have recently visited. As stated in their privacy policy Bellroy disclose that they share their usage data to, handle payments securely, to PayPal and Braintree, to distribute marketing via Mailchimp and Customer.io, to connect social media’s such as Pinterest or Facebook, to pay commission and to target advertising agencies such as Google and Facebook.
			<br>
			Bellroy only accept two payment types, either credit card or PayPal, the types of card they accept are; American Express, Visa and MasterCard.
			<br>
			While Bellroy does not require its users to have a fast internet connection, the site does contain auto play videos which must all be loaded by the client, thus to use the website you may need a strong internet connection. Even though Bellroy does not have different  mobile and desktop sites, the website still recognises that you are on mobile, instead of products being displayed in a grid format they are displayed in a list format where you can swipe to scroll between related products and scroll down to view different products. The menu system also changes depending on the type of device you are viewing the page on, for mobile devices the menu opens on a navbar on the left side of the screen, whereas on computer the menu appears as a normal menu just under the header.

			Bellroy.com shows one of the best use dynamic HTML I have seen on an E-commerce website. The website is simply beautiful, from its perfect sliding picture transitions, to its hidden menu system, to its cycling gallery and auto-play videos. Bellroy also uses a professional house style to draw in customers; it looks vibrant and efficiently uses auto-play videos and small pieces of JavaScript to give a very professional feel
			<br>
			All of the pages manage to keep the same theme, making the entire website more aesthetically pleasing, unfortunately three of their pages do not contain the main menu bar, and a few contain different back buttons. The site could be improved by standardising these features which would improve consistency and customer navigation. The most promising feature of the website is its use of the main menu, which is on almost every page; it features five main buttons which are never hidden, and each button has a colour change on hover, using the non-standard css class –webkit-tap-highlight-color, which most elements on the site use.  The centre button uses the Bellroy logo, clicking this button opens up the index page, this feature is on almost every page therefore it is easy for the customer to navigate back to the main page when needed. The other four buttons however have a completely different function, when clicked they each reveal their own hidden submenu, this works by the site having six different mainmenu classes; which act like different states, the website switches between states when you activate the trigger of clicking one of the top menu buttons which sets the height of the current main menu to 0px and changes the respective one to full height.
			<br>
			Another great feature used by Bellroy on the explore-new-ground page is how some text and images move and change opacity on scroll, the movement is changed by a class “transform: translateY(%)” which increases the Y value of the element as the page is scrolled down, meanwhile the opacity is changed by altering the default css class opacity between zero and one. Explore-new-ground contains two pictures which change size and opacity depending on which image is being hovered over. Bellroy achieves this by using -webkit-clip-path which clips an element to a basic shape, and allows you to animate the basic shape, moving the element. 
			<br>
			The use of video in Bellroy.com allows the site to look more dynamic without having to actually write very much code, this also attracts the customer as it is eye catching. Videos on the site fall into three categories. Either they are small auto-play on scroll videos placed next to each other as exampled on the protect-your-phone page. Simple auto-play videos which explain a small concept, or large videos which do not auto-play and tell a story. These features are informative yet capture the audience’s attention. The Barneys-new-york page contains a cycling gallery, where the left side switches between two images at opposite intervals to the right side, giving the illusion that more images are being cycled through. Bellroy.com also uses and references two third party companies in their JavaScript code, Bellroy uses https://errorception.com/ for all of their JavaScript error handling on the website, and http://snowplowanalytics.com/ is used by Bellroy to track their web analytics JavaScript.

			Bellroy.com demonstrates a good Logical Roadmap, all links and buttons are in intuitive places, this is important for a positive user experience. Crucial business information can also be found on the site in sensible places, finding the contact details and about information for the business is straight forward and simple. In recent years social media has gained an important role in business, every brand and company must have a face on social media, by integrating social media into their site via buttons Bellroy develop a business footprint on the social web and promote discussion and interaction between customers, building a consumer brand. With over 50% of global web traffic coming from mobile devices in 2015, making sure your site is mobile-ready is extremely important to businesses, according to director of Bing for Mobile, Andy Chu, mobile searches 70% of task completion happens within one hour compared to over a month for desktop searches. Thus in our modern environment, sites must now be designed for mobile instead of for viewing on a computer, therefore features such as fluid widths and touchscreen interactivity are essential. Customer questions are an important element of any business, therefore it is essential that Ecommerce sites contain a FAQ so customers can find answers to most questions they may have, this page must provide a comprehensive list of clear and concise answers. An Ecommerce site should also have a feedback system so the FAQ can be updated and the site can be developed to improve the efficiency of fulfilling the customer’s needs. 
			<br>
			Adverts play a central role in the marketing and growth of a company, which is why Bellroy.com collects analytical data and displays advertisements from three different advertising sources; Facebook, Google Ads and flashtalking.com. Each company provides dynamic adverts which map Bellroy’s customer demographic and tailor custom adverts to their users. Bellroy’s main source for adverts and analytics is Google, who provide the world with 2.3 million google searches a second and have an average user base of over a billion per month, Google has used this to revolutionise the advertisement market. Google provide Bellroy, and the majority of the Ecommerce market with two products that have redefined advertisement. Google analytics actively measures user interaction on the site and allows Bellroy to measure the number of transactions and revenue the website generates. Bellroy combine this with another product of Google, Google Ads which is split into two areas; AdWords and AdSense. Google AdWords chooses which adverts will appear on a client’s version of a website though use of the AdSense program and Google Display Network. Through use of both these products Bellroy can easily see consumer trends on their site and map their target demographic, this can then be used to customise their advertisement strategy to both fit their target audience and each individual user’s consumer habits.

		<p class="reporttext" id="conclusion">
			In conclusion, I feel Bellroy.com is a very strong Ecommerce website, it combines strong advertisement links with a clean aesthetic look to achieve a simple goal. Navigation through the site is effective, and the use of dynamic html and auto play videos promotes a positive user experience. I feel Bellroy uses its unique style to have advantages over its competitors such as asos and house of fraser, by promoting a more aesthetic, professional look which provides customers with a more familiarity.
